# Basic_Calculator
This repository contains a simple Python script for performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator accepts user inputs for two numbers and an operator to perform the desired calculation. NOTE: It's only for beginner!
# Features
Addition: Adds two numbers.

Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.

Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.

Division: Divides the first number by the second using integer division (i.e., discards the decimal part).
# How It Works
The program defines functions for each arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, and divide).

These functions are stored in a dictionary called operators, which maps symbols (+, -, *, /) to their corresponding functions.

The calculate function handles user input, validates the operator, performs the calculation, and prints the result.

Error handling is implemented to catch invalid inputs or exceptions (like division by zero).
# Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your_username/basic-calculator.git
Navigate to the repository's directory: cd basic-calculator
Run the program: python calculator.py
# Example
Enter your first number: 10
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: +
Enter your second number: 5
Your result is: 10 + 5 = 15.
